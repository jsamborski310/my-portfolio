## The Project

The simple one-page site was built with HTML and CSS. The code needed to be overhauled to meet accessibility standards. Additionally, code clean up was required to achieve best practices, make it easier for developers to work on, and SEO. 

Website accessibility is vital. It enables users with various disabilities to engage with the site. Accessible sites are also ranked higher on Google.

## Getting to Work

Code was refactored. Applied proper indentations, replaced unnecessary div's with semantic elements, added descriptions to images, condensed selectors and consolidated properties. Additionally, commented on both the HTML and CSS files, describing each section, making the code easier to read.
